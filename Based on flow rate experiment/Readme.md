### Wax Deposition Rate Prediction based on 4 ML Models

This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting the wax deposition rate within pipelines, a significant challenge impacting flow efficiency and requiring costly maintenance.
Four machine learning models are employed: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models are trained and evaluated using a dataset containing operational parameters including oil temperature, wall temperature, rotation speed, wall shear stress, oil viscosity, wax crystal solubility coefficient, and temperature gradient, with the aim of predicting the wax deposition rate.
The results demonstrate exceptional performance from both MLP and XGBoost, achieving R-squared values exceeding 0.99, indicating their remarkable ability to accurately predict the wax deposition rate. LGBM also performs well with an R-squared of 0.92, while SVM delivers a slightly lower R-squared of 0.8.
This study highlights the potential of machine learning models, particularly MLP and XGBoost Regressor, for accurate prediction of wax deposition rates in pipelines. By incorporating key operational factors, these models can be valuable tools for optimizing pipeline operations and minimizing the risks associated with wax deposition.
