# Wax-Prediction-model
## Part-01 Based on weight percentage of wax obtained
Wax deposition is a significant operational challenge in the oil and gas industry, leading to reduced flow assurance and potential pipeline blockages. Accurate prediction of wax deposition is crucial for optimizing production processes and preventing costly downtime. 

This study investigates the application of four machine learning models – multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, and LightGBM (LGBM) – for predicting wax deposition in oil pipelines using composition, temperature, and specific gravity of oils. The performance of each model is evaluated based on their ability to predict wax deposition in a dataset comprising experimental measurements and corresponding input parameters. 

The results demonstrate that all four models exhibit promising predictive capabilities, with XGBoost and SVM achieving the highest accuracy. 

The study highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in providing reliable wax deposition predictions, enabling proactive measures to mitigate wax deposition issues and enhance operational efficiency in the oil and gas industry.

## Part-02 Based on Pipeline data

This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting the wax deposition rate within pipelines, a significant challenge impacting flow efficiency and requiring costly maintenance.
Four machine learning models are employed: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models are trained and evaluated using a dataset containing operational parameters including oil temperature, wall temperature, rotation speed, wall shear stress, oil viscosity, wax crystal solubility coefficient, and temperature gradient, with the aim of predicting the wax deposition rate.
The results demonstrate exceptional performance from both MLP and XGBoost, achieving R-squared values exceeding 0.99, indicating their remarkable ability to accurately predict the wax deposition rate. LGBM also performs well with an R-squared of 0.92, while SVM delivers a slightly lower R-squared of 0.8.
This study highlights the potential of machine learning models, particularly MLP and XGBoost Regressor, for accurate prediction of wax deposition rates in pipelines. By incorporating key operational factors, these models can be valuable tools for optimizing pipeline operations and minimizing the risks associated with wax deposition.
