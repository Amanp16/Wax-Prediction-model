# Wax-Prediction-model
## Part-01 Based on weight percentage of wax obtained
Wax deposition is a significant operational challenge in the oil and gas industry, leading to reduced flow assurance and potential pipeline blockages. Accurate prediction of wax deposition is crucial for optimizing production processes and preventing costly downtime. 

This study investigates the application of four machine learning models – multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, and LightGBM (LGBM) – for predicting wax deposition in oil pipelines using composition, temperature, and specific gravity of oils. The performance of each model is evaluated based on their ability to predict wax deposition in a dataset comprising experimental measurements and corresponding input parameters. 

The results demonstrate that all four models exhibit promising predictive capabilities, with XGBoost and SVM achieving the highest accuracy. 

The study highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in providing reliable wax deposition predictions, enabling proactive measures to mitigate wax deposition issues and enhance operational efficiency in the oil and gas industry.
